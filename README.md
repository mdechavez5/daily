# Daily Coding Practice

## Python VS Javascript
- JavaScript is a scripting language that helps you create interactive web pages, while Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language that has built-in data structures, combined with dynamic binding and typing, which makes it an ideal choice for rapid application development.

- JavaScript has no concept of mutable and immutable but Python has mutable and immutable data types.

- JavaScript should be encoded as UTF-16 as it does not offer any built-in support for manipulating raw bytes, whereas Python source code is ASCII by default unless you are specifying any encoding format.

- JavaScript uses curly brackets whereas Python language uses indentation

- JavaScript objects have properties that can be composed of underlying attributes which let you define a property, and in Python programming language, getter and setter functions are used to defining an attribute.

- JavaScript helps you to build a website or native application whereas Python is for tasks related to data analytics, machine learning, and math-intensive operations.

## Python VS JavaScript: Syntax
Now that you know what they are used for, let's see how they are written and the differences in their syntax.

We will cover the differences in their main elements:

- Code Blocks
- Variable Definitions
- Variable Naming Conventions
- Constants
- Data Types and Values
- Comments
- Built-in Data Structures
- Operators
- Input/Output
- Conditional Statements
- For Loops and While Loops
- Functions
- Object-Oriented Programming

## Can Python replace JavaScript?
Python will not be able to replace JavaScript because: 

(FRONT-END) JavaScript is browser-native, whereas Python is not. 
(BACK-END) Neither JavaScript nor Python are web-native programming languages. As a result, they will work in tandem.

## Python VS JS: Real World Applications
Python
Python has become an essential tool in virtually every scientific application around the world because of its power and versatility. It is a general-purpose programming language that supports different programming paradigms.

It is widely used in scientific and specialized applications, including data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science education, computer vision and image processing, medicine, biology, and even astronomy.

It is also used for web development. This is where we can start to compare its applications to the applications of JavaScript. Python is used for back-end development, which is the area of web development in charge of creating the elements that users don't see, such as the server side of an application.

JavaScript
While Python can be used to develop the back-end part of a web application, JavaScript can be used to develop both the back-end and the front-end of the application.

The front-end is the part of the application that the user sees and interacts with. Whenever you see or interact with a website or web application, you are using JavaScript "behind the scenes".

Similarly, when you interact with a mobile app, you might be using JavaScript because frameworks like React Native let us write applications that adapt to different platforms.

JavaScript is so widely used in web development because it is a versatile language that gives us the tools we need to develop the components of a web application.

Differences between the applications of Python and JavaScript
In short, developers use Python for a range of scientific applications. They use JavaScript for web development, user-facing functionality, and servers
