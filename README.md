# Daily Coding Practice

## Python VS Javascript
- JavaScript is a scripting language that helps you create interactive web pages, while Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language that has built-in data structures, combined with dynamic binding and typing, which makes it an ideal choice for rapid application development.

- JavaScript has no concept of mutable and immutable but Python has mutable and immutable data types.

- JavaScript should be encoded as UTF-16 as it does not offer any built-in support for manipulating raw bytes, whereas Python source code is ASCII by default unless you are specifying any encoding format.

- JavaScript uses curly brackets whereas Python language uses indentation

- JavaScript objects have properties that can be composed of underlying attributes which let you define a property, and in Python programming language, getter and setter functions are used to defining an attribute.

- JavaScript helps you to build a website or native application whereas Python is for tasks related to data analytics, machine learning, and math-intensive operations.

## Python VS JavaScript: Syntax
Now that you know what they are used for, let's see how they are written and the differences in their syntax.

We will cover the differences in their main elements:

- Code Blocks
- Variable Definitions
- Variable Naming Conventions
- Constants
- Data Types and Values
- Comments
- Built-in Data Structures
- Operators
- Input/Output
- Conditional Statements
- For Loops and While Loops
- Functions
- Object-Oriented Programming

## Can Python replace JavaScript?
Python will not be able to replace JavaScript because: 

(FRONT-END) JavaScript is browser-native, whereas Python is not. 
(BACK-END) Neither JavaScript nor Python are web-native programming languages. As a result, they will work in tandem.

## Python VS JS: Real World Applications
Python
Python has become an essential tool in virtually every scientific application around the world because of its power and versatility. It is a general-purpose programming language that supports different programming paradigms.

It is widely used in scientific and specialized applications, including data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science education, computer vision and image processing, medicine, biology, and even astronomy.

It is also used for web development. This is where we can start to compare its applications to the applications of JavaScript. Python is used for back-end development, which is the area of web development in charge of creating the elements that users don't see, such as the server side of an application.

JavaScript
While Python can be used to develop the back-end part of a web application, JavaScript can be used to develop both the back-end and the front-end of the application.

The front-end is the part of the application that the user sees and interacts with. Whenever you see or interact with a website or web application, you are using JavaScript "behind the scenes".

Similarly, when you interact with a mobile app, you might be using JavaScript because frameworks like React Native let us write applications that adapt to different platforms.

JavaScript is so widely used in web development because it is a versatile language that gives us the tools we need to develop the components of a web application.

Differences between the applications of Python and JavaScript
In short, developers use Python for a range of scientific applications. They use JavaScript for web development, user-facing functionality, and servers

## Here are 5 reasons Python is a great programming language, but JavaScript is better.
 

1. JavaScript is better for website development
Hands down, JavaScript is undeniably better than Python for website development for one simple reason: JS runs in the browser while Python is a backend server-side language.

While Python can be used in part to create a website, it can’t be used alone. Python must be used to respond to requests that return HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, using Python to build a website is a complicated process. Frameworks exist to make the task easier – like Django and Flask – but even so, using Python isn’t optimal.

JavaScript is the better choice for desktop and mobile websites. Between JQuery, Angular, and React, JavaScript provides virtually endless capabilities for web programming.

2. Experienced developers are more likely to know JavaScript
When a business or individual hires a programmer for a project, having an experienced developer is the key to a successful project. The problem with Python developers is that you never know how much real-world experience they have. The same can be said of JavaScript developers, however, it’s easier to find experienced JS developers because it’s been a standard for decades.

While Python was launched in 1989 – about six years before JavaScript – Python didn’t become popular until Google adopted it and invested in its further development. That means the majority of seasoned developers who got their start in the 1990s are likely to be experienced with JavaScript over Python.

3. JavaScript provides a direct path into the IT world
There will always be die-hard Python fans who can make a good argument for learning Python. However, if you want to get into the tech world, JavaScript is the golden ticket.

Since JavaScript is a necessary component of front-end website development, you’ll have the skills necessary to generate income either as a freelancer or on a team.

Browsing around job listing sites in search of programming jobs reveals a significant preference for JavaScript programmers. While some businesses may not know what programming language is best for their particular project, if they’re working on a front-end website project, they’ll need at least some JavaScript development.

4. JavaScript is easy to learn
Although many people say Python is easier to learn than JavaScript, that’s not true for people with a programming mindset. JS basics can be learned in just months, and with a year of dedication, a person can start earning decent money with their skills.

5. JavaScript is historically the most popular programming language
JavaScript has been popular since its first release in 1995, and that’s not going to change any time soon. Even today, Brendan Eich, JavaScript’s key designer, says that every web developer needs to know JavaScript, Java, and Python.

While Python is a good programming language to have under your belt, it’s not a standalone solution for web development. Python is a helpful addition to existing web programming languages, but can’t do much by itself.

It could be considered a logical fallacy to say JavaScript is better because it’s been popular for a long time, but programming languages remain popular for good reason. That reason is functionality, reliability, and ease of use. JavaScript fulfills all of those requirements.
