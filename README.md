# Daily Coding Practice

## Python VS Javascript
- JavaScript is a scripting language that helps you create interactive web pages, while Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language that has built-in data structures, combined with dynamic binding and typing, which makes it an ideal choice for rapid application development.

- JavaScript has no concept of mutable and immutable but Python has mutable and immutable data types.

- JavaScript should be encoded as UTF-16 as it does not offer any built-in support for manipulating raw bytes, whereas Python source code is ASCII by default unless you are specifying any encoding format.

- JavaScript uses curly brackets whereas Python language uses indentation

- JavaScript objects have properties that can be composed of underlying attributes which let you define a property, and in Python programming language, getter and setter functions are used to defining an attribute.

- JavaScript helps you to build a website or native application whereas Python is for tasks related to data analytics, machine learning, and math-intensive operations.

## Python VS JavaScript: Syntax
Now that you know what they are used for, let's see how they are written and the differences in their syntax.

We will cover the differences in their main elements:

- Code Blocks
- Variable Definitions
- Variable Naming Conventions
- Constants
- Data Types and Values
- Comments
- Built-in Data Structures
- Operators
- Input/Output
- Conditional Statements
- For Loops and While Loops
- Functions
- Object-Oriented Programming
